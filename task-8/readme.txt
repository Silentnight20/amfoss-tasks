Actually I took some time in understanding the question. As I got the question, then I tried the command given the task-set document, which gave me all commits in cms.
So after observing this, and idea immediately came that in place of cms we have to put name of repo name. 
So after some googling and from my previous conclusion, I used for loop. And thus, I did it.
