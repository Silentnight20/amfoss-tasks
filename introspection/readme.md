# Introspection
### Why must we choose you?
I am a dedicated guy. I will definetly do works for mine as well as club's benifit. I used to and still believe that coding and me will go quite good with each other.


### How were you before joining and how are you now
Before joining I knew nothing regarding coding or anything. But now I have progressed a lot when compared to my past and little when compared to my future. But it's okay. In one sentence, I am happy but not satisfied.

### What are your comments and suggestions regarding the selection process
Well for me it was little hard as I had no prior CS background, but it's okay. Exploring will only give more experience rather than a cage. I would rather be a flying eagle than toad of a well. But we have tests in b/w as well as assignments so it was really challenging for me. But I didn't give up.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Get CGPA above 8.5 so that my parents can have a tension free life. And personally I want to work on some projects and gain experiences and prepare for GSOC 2021.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will actively participate in all activites in club and will do the tasks assigned by the clubs. I'll improve my skill set and help the club in whichever way I can. Also I like managing stuffs, so I can help the club in all those activites too.
